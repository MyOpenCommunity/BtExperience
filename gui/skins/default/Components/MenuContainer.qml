/**
  \ingroup Core

  \brief A component to manage a group of related menus.

  The MenuContainer component encapsulates logic to show a hierarchical list
  of MenuColumn that may have different sizes and behaviors. Menu items are
  arranged horizontally inside the MenuContainer until their width sum overtakes
  the container width. At that point, first elements are hidden.
  Every item must emit the loadComponent signal to request loading a child
  element. A closeItem signal is used to close the menu item.
