  \brief The intercom management page.

  This page is responsible to manage incoming intercom calls. When an
  intercom call arrives, the EventManager shows it up.
  The page opens a popup containing the ControlCall component which is the
  true responsible of the call management. When call terminates, application
  resumes from the point of last execution.
