/**
  \ingroup Core

  \brief Maximum number of customized images per profile.

  Maximum number of customized images per type and per profile stored. Custom
  images are saved in the extra/12 folder. To avoid filling all the available
  space a limit on the number of images to retain is needed. This parameter is
  such a limit. Every time a user customizes her image a new image is created
  in the extra/12 folder. If images linked to that profile are more than this
  number, older images are deleted. It is suggested to set this parameter to
  a value of at least 2 to avoid "losing" the image in case of errors before
  the system saves the configuration (the saving is delayed).

  A class to save custom images. Images may be on a local folder, but they may

  created above (you must be sure the instance is deleted when the download
  operation is completed). Then call the startDownload method and you are done.
