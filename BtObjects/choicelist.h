	In some cases, not all possible values are available to the user, but only
	some of them.
	For example, all fancoil speeds are: auto, min, med, max, silent.
	A specific fancoil may be configured to have only auto, max, silent.
	This class is used to manage only those and not all the possible values.
	The class manages int values because it expects that such values are enums.
